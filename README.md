# Question: How do you implement a monotonic stack to solve problems like daily temperatures? C# Summary

The provided C# code is a console application that uses a monotonic stack to solve the daily temperatures problem. The problem is to determine how many days one would have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day. The program uses an array of integers to represent the daily temperatures and another array to store the results. It uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures. The program iterates from the end of the temperatures array to the beginning. For each temperature, it pops the stack until it finds a higher temperature or the stack is empty. The result for the current temperature is the difference between its index and the index of the higher temperature, or 0 if there is no higher temperature. This way, the program efficiently calculates the number of days one would have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows the same logic as the C# version. Both versions use a monotonic stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures and iterate from the end of the array to the beginning. For each temperature, they pop the stack until they find a higher temperature or the stack is empty. The result for the current temperature is the difference between its index and the index of the higher temperature, or 0 if there is no higher temperature.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. In Python, the stack is implemented using a list, while in C#, a Stack class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace is used.

2. In Python, the length of the list is obtained using the len() function, while in C#, the Length property of the array is used.

3. In Python, the last element of the list (top of the stack) is accessed using the index -1 (stack[-1]), while in C#, the Peek() method of the Stack class is used.

4. In Python, elements are added to the end of the list (pushed onto the stack) using the append() method, while in C#, the Push() method of the Stack class is used.

5. In Python, the input temperatures are read from the console using the input() function and split into a list of integers using the map() and split() functions. In C#, the temperatures are hardcoded into the program.

6. In Python, the main function is defined and called explicitly, while in C#, the Main() method is automatically called when the program is run.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are very similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both use a monotonic stack to keep track of the indices of the temperatures and iterate from the end of the array to the beginning. For each temperature, they pop the stack until they find a higher temperature or the stack is empty. The result for the current temperature is the difference between its index and the index of the higher temperature, or 0 if there is no higher temperature.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions due to the different language features and methods in Java and C#:

1. Input: In the C# version, the temperatures are hardcoded into the program, while in the Java version, the program takes the number of days and the temperatures for those days as input from the user.

2. Stack: In C#, the stack is implemented using the `Stack` class from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, while in Java, it is implemented using the `Stack` class from the `java.util` package.

3. Stack operations: In C#, the `Count` property is used to check if the stack is empty and the `Peek` method is used to look at the top element of the stack. In Java, the `isEmpty` method is used to check if the stack is empty and the `peek` method is used to look at the top element of the stack.

4. Output: In the C# version, the results are printed to the console with a space in between each number. In the Java version, each number is printed on a new line.

5. Method naming: In C#, the method is named `DailyTemperatures` following the PascalCase convention, while in Java, the method is named `dailyTemperatures` following the camelCase convention.
